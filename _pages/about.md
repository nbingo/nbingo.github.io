Hey! I'm a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Cornell University advised by the
wonderful [Eshan Chattopadhyay](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eshan/). Before
beginning my PhD, I did my undergrad in math and master's in CS at Stanford.
I had a great time working in the [Luo Lab](https://luolab.stanford.edu) with
[Justus Kebschull](https://www.kebschull-lab.org).

While I enjoyed my formative research years in wet lab neuroscience, I am
currently interested in theoretical computer science, specifically pseudorandomness, combinatorics, and complexity
theory. My recent work is mainly on
condensing from adversarial sources, lossless expansion in bipartite graphs,
and coin flipping/leader election protocols,
but who knows where my interests will take me in the future!

I am grateful to be supported by the NSF GRFP (DGE â€“ 2139899).
