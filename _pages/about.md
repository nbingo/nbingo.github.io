Hey! I'm a third year in computer science at Cornell University advised by the
wonderful [Eshan Chattopadhyay](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~eshan/). Before
beginning my PhD, I did my undergrad in math and master's in CS at Stanford.
I had a great time working in the [Luo Lab](https://luolab.stanford.edu) with
[Justus Kebschull](https://www.kebschull-lab.org).

While I enjoyed my formative research years in wet lab neuroscience, I am
currently interested in theoretical computer science, specifically complexity
theory, pseudorandomness, and combinatorics. My recent work is mainly on
condensing from adversarial sources and lossless expansion in bipartite graphs,
but who knows where my interests will take me in the future!

P.S. This site is still under construction while I add o(1) information!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
